      - title: "NewsGPT: Intelligent News Summarization with Extractive and Abstractive Methods" 
        content: "Developed an efficient news summarization application using two distinct methods: extractive summarization and abstractive summarization with GPT-3. The extractive approach selects the most important sentences from the original article, while the abstractive method generates human-like summaries using GPT-3's language understanding capabilities. Implemented a comparison feature to highlight the differences in content, style, and length between the two approaches. Created an intuitive web interface using Gradio for easy user interaction and summary evaluation."
